      <h2>Stay Safe Online</h2>
      <p>It's important to be cautious and vigilant when dealing with online transactions and communications. Here are some tips to protect yourself from fraud:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your personal information secure. Never share sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers or financial details, through email or phone.</li>
        <li>Verify the legitimacy of emails and websites. Be cautious of unexpected emails asking for personal information or urgent actions.</li>
        <li>Use strong and unique passwords. Create passwords with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). Add an extra layer of security to your online accounts with 2FA whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Update software and security patches regularly. Keep your operating system, antivirus software, and applications up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links and downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could lead to phishing scams or malware infections.</li>
        <li>Be cautious with charity donations and fundraisers. Verify the legitimacy of charitable organizations before making any donations.</li>
        <li>Take your time to make well-informed decisions. Fraudsters often pressure victims to act quickly; don't be rushed into any financial or personal decisions.</li>
        <li>Stay informed about the latest scams and fraud tactics. Regularly check official sources and news updates to be aware of new threats.</li>
      </ul>
